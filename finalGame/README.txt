This is my project 2 submission. 
Not all parts have been completed due to time constrictions. 

WORKING:
	Hero movement [PART 1-3]
		- hero attack sprite has bugs 
		- all other movements work 
		- Airborne movement for Entities is implemented (jump and fall)
	
	Enemy - Hero interaction [Part 4]
		- Walking into enemies kills the Hero 
		- Hitting the enemies with the Kunai kills them 

	Weapon Works [5]
		- weapon moves until despawning from time, hitting enemy, or terrain 
		- only 1 weapon at a time 
	Scrolling Works [7]
		- Level moves as player navigates
INCOMPLETE 
	Hero attack
		- Bug with the alt-key being the only one to trigger the on_key_press listener
		- Attack sequence does not play 
	Hero win 
		- No time to implement the snowman completion
